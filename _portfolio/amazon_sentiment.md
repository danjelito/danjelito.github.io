This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews using two models: VADER (a rule-based model from NLTK) and RoBERTa (a transformer-based model from Hugging Face).  

We evaluate the models' performance using regression metrics such as MSE, MAE, and RÂ², and perform error analysis to identify where the models deviate most from true scores.
