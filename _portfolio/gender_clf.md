Exploring SHAP for feature interpretability in a simplified gender classification project using machine learning.  

This project demonstrates how SHAP can provide transparency into model predictions.  

By visualizing the contribution of each feature to the final decision, we gain a deeper understanding of how different attributes, such as age or occupation, influence the classification.
