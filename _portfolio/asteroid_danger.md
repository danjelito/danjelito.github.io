Astronomers and space astrophysicists know a lot about asteroids: how big they are, how fast they're moving, and how far they are from Earth.  

I use this info to predict whether an asteroid is dangerous or not, using a stacked ensemble: an algorithm that combines multiple ML models to create a more robust prediction system.
