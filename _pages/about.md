Hi, I'm **Devan Anjelito**, a data practitioner working at the intersection of business and data. By day, I lead Business Intelligence team at Gentem Lifelong Learning Indonesia. By night, I write some dumb things, experiment, and think aloud, mostly through code.

This website is where I share things I’ve learned, questions I’m exploring, and projects I’m building. Some of it is technical (machine learning, data analysis, statistics), some of it is reflective (on learning, work, book), and some of it is just me trying to figure things out in public.

***Use the navigation bar above to see my [blog posts](https://danjelito.github.io/year-archive/), [portfolio](https://danjelito.github.io/portfolio/), and [CV](https://danjelito.github.io/cv/).***

What you’ll find here
------
- Essays and short notes on data, learning, and decision-making
- End-to-end machine learning and data science projects with commentary
- Technical deep dives with reproducible code and explanations

If any of this resonates with you, or if you want to chat about data, ideas, or paths into machine learning, feel free to [get in touch](mailto:anjelitodevan@gmail.com).
