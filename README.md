# Devan's Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio site, built with [Academic Pages](https://academicpages.github.io/) and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Portfolio Projects:** Machine learning, data analysis, computer vision, and visualization projects.  
- **Blog Posts:** Essays, tutorials, and personal notes about tech, data, and learning.  
- **About Me:** Info about my background and interests.
- Othe random stuffs

## How This Site Works

- The site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and Academic Pages template.
- Content is organized in folders:
  - `_portfolio/` for project pages
  - `_posts/` for blog articles
  - `_pages/` for static pages (like About)
  - `etc`
- All images and files are stored in the `images/` and `files/` folders.
