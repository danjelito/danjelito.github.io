I hate Windows with passion and will not dilly-dally. Here are the reasons:

## 1. Poor Performance

**Windows eats up RAM and CPU even at idle, making the system slow**. Background services, telemetry, and auto-updates only make it worse. Add an old filesystem and disk fragmentation into the mix, and even high-end laptops feel sluggish. My ASUS TUF A15? On Windows, it sometimes feels like a Pentium laptop. It’s just insane.

## 2. Telemetry and Privacy Issues

**Windows collects a ton of data by default, and turning off telemetry is a pain**; it’s never fully disabled. You usually need tools like [Chris Titus Tech's Windows Utility](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil). Haven’t heard of it? Go check it. And if you think that’s bad, wait until you hear about the biggest telemetry of them all: Microsoft Recall.

## 3. Bloatware and Pre-installed Apps

My new laptop came loaded with Office trial, McAfee, Candy Crush, Solitaire, Twitter, PicsArt, Netflix, Spotify, LinkedIn… and the list goes on. Who actually wants all these apps preinstalled? It took me 30 minutes just to uninstall them, and even then, many can’t be fully removed, wasting space and resources.

## 4. Frustrating Start Menu

Slow and unresponsive, especially when many apps are installed. What’s up with the Start menu, really? The search function is completely unreliable it can’t find anything. And don’t get me started on customization: it’s basically nonexistent.

## 5. Limited Keymap Customization

On Linux, I always have non-negotiable keymaps, like Super+Q to quit an app. On Windows, key remapping is nonexistent. You need third-party tools, which are often buggy or insecure.

## 6. Updates and Forced Restarts

Ah yes, the infamous Windows Updates. Have you ever been in the middle of an important task when an update suddenly interrupts you? Updates can break drivers or software, downloads often fail even on fast internet, and the whole scheduling system is confusing and inflexible.

## 7. Settings Chaos

**Windows has a mess of overlapping settings interfaces**: old Settings, new Settings, Control Panel, and the Registry Editor. Finding the right option is confusing, and it’s often unclear which setting actually applies. Customization frequently requires digging through obscure menus or even the registry.

## 8. Licensing and Cost

**Windows licenses are expensive** compared to free alternatives like Linux, which if FREE. It is free despite being objectively better. Need I tell you more.

Like I said, I hate Windows with passion. It’s disappointing because I once loved Windows. My first PC ran XP, and I spent hours enjoying Winamp, Age of Empires 2 and Mozilla Firefox. Today, it feels bloated, slow, and unpredictable. It is hard to believe a company with Microsoft’s resources could let it degrade this much. What was once a platform of freedom now often feels like a set of limitations.
