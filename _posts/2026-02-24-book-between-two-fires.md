# Book Review: Between Two Fires

In a time of war between heaven and hell, humanity is caught between two fires. Now Thomas, a disgraced knight, and Matthieu, an alcoholic priest, must embark on a pilgrimage to bring a little girl they meet on the road to Avignon to safety, as she seemingly holds the key to saving the world.

I remember getting a recommendation for _Between Two Fires_ from a certain BookTuber. Too bad I forgot who it was, because the book is so good! I went into this book not knowing anything, and I was blown away.

The story itself is quite simple. They are on a mission to reach a destination, and along the way we see the devastating effects of a plague ravaging medieval France. The medieval setting really enhances the horror. The descriptions of people suffering from the plague are vivid, making us truly understand the terror of it. The descriptions of people suffering of plague (or of whatever) are vivid and sometimes uncomfortable to read, but i a good way. It makes the world seem really dark and cruel.

What really makes this book shine, though, is the characters. Our three pilgrims are far from perfect. Thomas carries guilt and pride from his past. Matthieu struggles with his faith and his addiction. The little girl is mysterious, quiet, and much stronger than she looks. Their flaws make them feel human. Their interactions are often very funny, especially the banter between Thomas and Matthieu. Even in the darkest situations, their conversations made me smile.

And the last 10 pages or so, oh my God. Tears in my eyes. I rarely cry during books or movies, yet those final pages absolutely broke me. It was such a beautiful and emotional ending for our dear characters.

Overall, this book is a mix of dark fantasy, historical horror, and a surprisingly heartfelt story about faith, guilt, and companionship. It may start as a simple journey, but it becomes so much more. I didn’t expect to love it this much, but here I am, still thinking about these characters and their pilgrimage long after finishing the last page.

6/5
