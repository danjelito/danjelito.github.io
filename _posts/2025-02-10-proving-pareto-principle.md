I am a big fan of the Pareto Principle, which states that **80% of results often come from just 20% of efforts**. But how can we prove this principle with data?

To explore this, I analyzed a subset of Wikipedia text (God I love this). Here’s what I did:

1. Created a list of all unique words appearing in the original document.  
2. Identified the top 20% most common words.  
3. Checked how much of the original document these words covered.

The result? **These 20% most common words made up 84% of the document!** Pareto Principle FTW!

What does this mean in practice? *Assuming this Wikipedia subset is representative of how we use English, understanding the 20% most common words could get you 80% of the way to understanding the language*. Isn't this crazy?

The same idea applies to other areas of life. For example:

- **At work**: With so many tasks competing for your attention (I feel you), focusing on the 20% that truly matter can drive 80% of your impact.  
- **In relationships**: Investing in the 20% of connections that are most meaningful can bring 80% of your personal fulfillment.  
- **In personal growth**: Whether it’s learning a new skill, improving your health, or managing your time, focusing on the 20% of activities with the highest payoff can yield 80% of the results.

Prioritize wisely.
