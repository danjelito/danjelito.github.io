# Book Review: Chain-Gang All-Stars

_Chain-Gang All-Stars_ paints a future where prisoners are offered a chance at freedom by participating in a gladiatorial program, fighting to the death for public entertainment. The event goes beyond the fights themselves, complete with a TV program that explores the inmates’ lives outside of the fights, essentially stripping them of privacy. The violence is horrific, but the real horror is everything around them. The sponsorship, branding, and polite language used to justify the cruelty.

What stood out the most is its structure. The book constantly shifts perspective. At first, this feels fragmented. Over time, it becomes clear that this is the point. To understand the horror, we must look through many lenses: the inmates, the TV enjoyers, the protesters, the guards, even the drivers who transport the inmates to their deaths. Each voice shows a different way people survive, rationalize, or benefit from it. Some resist. Others adapt. Many simply accept it.

As a character-driven reader, of course I have favorite characters. This time, I have two. Hendrix "Scorpion Singer" Young and Simon "Unkillable Jungle" Craft are an unlikely duo shaped by tragedy, bonding over song and violence. They can't be any more different from each other, but their unique camaraderie is very compelling. My complaint is that I got too little of Scorpion Singer and Unkillable Jungle in this book.

_Chain-Gang All-Stars_ is not subtle, but it is precise. If you are interested in power, punishment, and how easily cruelty becomes content, this book is worth your attention.

4/5
