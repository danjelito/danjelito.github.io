I've been noticing something interesting: about 90% of my colleagues at work use an iPhone. Even back home in my small town, about 25% of people I know use one. When you compare the price of an iPhone to Indonesian median income, this is wild! For an average Indonesian, it takes 139 working days just to afford an iPhone. And that’s working days, not calendar days! And this doesn’t even account for our other living expenses!

Now here’s the kicker: an American only needs 12 working days to buy an iPhone, and even they say iPhones are expensive (see Marques Brownlee)!

So before you decide to buy an iPhone, ask yourself: is this phone, which functions just like any other (a lot) cheaper phone, really worth 139 days of your hard-earned work?

I get it. The camera is amazing, the UI is sleek, and yes, that Apple logo is something you want to show off. I even know someone who bought a case with a hole specifically around the logo so everyone knows it's an iPhone.

But 139 days? Really???
