## How a Broken Laptop Led Me to Linux

Three years ago, my office laptop broke. I sent it to the shop for repair, and the IT team gave me a temporary replacement. It was a really old Dell laptop. The body was so worn out, it didn’t even have a lid for the screen. It was running Windows 10.

Windows 10, as we all know, is **heavy**. It was already slow on my main laptop. On this old one, it was a nightmare. Even opening a browser caused stuttering every few seconds.

Then I remembered a YouTube video I watched a few weeks earlier. It said Linux could save old laptops. I was curious. I was also frustrated with this machine. So I installed Ubuntu. Why not?

And I was shocked.

The desktop looked clean. There was a bar at the top, a dock on the left, and a beautiful purple wallpaper. I always thought Linux was some scary terminal-only thing. But this? This was beautiful.

I ended up using Ubuntu for two weeks. During that time, I learned that Linux is not what I thought. It’s not just for geeks or programmers. It’s fast, modern, and easy to use. That old laptop suddenly felt usable again. Even fun to use.

Today, three years later, I’m still using Linux. I now run Fedora with KDE. I’ve switched distros many times: just last month I reinstalled three times, trying Fedora GNOME, Fedora Sway, and now Fedora KDE. Linux made me love computers again.

I don’t think I’ll ever go back to Windows.

## Why I Prefer Linux Over Windows

Here are some things I’ve noticed after switching to Linux:

* **It’s fast and lightweight**
  Linux runs smoothly even on old hardware. No more lag just to open a browser.

* **No bloatware**
  Windows comes with apps I never use (and ads on the desktop!). Linux gives me a clean start, and I choose what to install.

* **Updates are fast and don’t interrupt**
  Windows updates always come at the wrong time. Linux updates are quick and don’t force restarts.

* **Better privacy**
  Linux doesn’t track my activity. No ads, no data collection, no weird background processes.

* **Customizable**
  I can change almost everything: the look, the shortcuts, the tools. This is the thing I love the most. 

* **It’s free**
  No licenses, no hidden costs. Most Linux software is open source.

* **Strong community**
  If I have a problem, someone online has likely faced it too. Forums and documentation are super helpful.

* **Fun to learn**
  Using Linux made me more curious about how computers work. I learned so much just by exploring and tweaking things.
