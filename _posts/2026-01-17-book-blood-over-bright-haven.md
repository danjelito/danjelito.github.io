# Book Review: Blood Over Bright Haven

The City of Tiran is fueled by magic; its trains run on magic, water is fetched from the river magically, and the entire city is shielded from the freezing cold of the outside world by a magical barrier. In this world of magic, men rule the society. All high-ranking wizards are men, and Sciona aims to be the first woman to enter the ministry of magic. In her pursuit, she uncovers secrets that might change not only herself but the whole world as she knows it.

I went into _Blood Over Bright Haven_ expecting a familiar fantasy setup, and for the first hundred pages or so, that is what I got. However, the book refuses to stay comfortable. What begins as a simple academic pursuit turns into a confrontation of power, secrets, and violence.

This book carries so many relevant topics, the first being the male dominance in the academic field. Sciona, despite being a brilliant mage, struggles in a system that is built for males. This mirrors modern academia, where discrimination still exists, whether based on gender, race, or affiliation. Another major topic is exploitation, illustrated by the exploitation of non-Tiranian factions, often seen as less than human. But my favorite question from this book is this: should someone be held responsible for a crime they did not know they were committing?

_Blood Over Bright Haven_ is a story about intelligence without ethics, progress without accountability, and knowledge without conscience. It is not an easy read, but it forces the reader to question the systems they live in.

4/5
